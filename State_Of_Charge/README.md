# State_Of_Charge
 
  **Abbreviations\Symbols used in the code and their physical\actual meaning and units**
    - z    :  State of Charge
    - R    :  Internal Resistance(Ohms)
    - Q    :  Cell capacity(Wh)
    - v    :  Cell  terminal voltage(V)
    - rc   :  Resistor Capacitor Parameters
    - s    :  Instantaneous Hysteresis
    - h    :  Dynamic Hysteresis
    - t    :  Time
 
 **Overview of the code**
 The codes are used in supplement with the books **Battery Management Systems I and II, by Gregory Plett** and the course **Algorithms for Battery Management System, by Coursera**
 
 This branch(State_of_charge) of the main folder(BatteryManagementSystem_Algorithm_usingMatlab) aims to determine the State of Charge of an individual Lithium-Ion Cell and also the State of Charge of an Electric Vehicle Battery. The methods used consist of Kalman Filter methods and its varieties. The Kalman filter based approach is the best method for linear systems. While for the nonlinear systems Unscented Kalman Filter based methods are used.
